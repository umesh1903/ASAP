Project Title "Bounce-o-Shoe"

Project Overview
Bounce-o-Shoe is a fun web app where users can design their own bouncing shoe. The shoe will jump around the screen as if it has a mind of its own, bouncing off walls, floors, and other shoes. Users can adjust the shoe's bounce height, speed, and color. Itâ€™s all about making the goofiest, bounciest shoe experience!

Key Features

Customizable Shoes: Choose different shoe designs and colors for your bouncing shoes.
Bounce Settings: Adjust how high and how fast your shoe bounces with sliders.
Shoes Everywhere: You can add more shoes to the screen and watch them bounce around together.
Bounce Sound Effects: Every time the shoe bounces, it makes a silly sound like a "boing" or "splat."
Save and Share: Capture a screenshot of your bouncing shoe masterpiece and share it with friends.
Wall Bounce Physics: Shoes bounce off walls or floors with realistic (but still funny) physics.
Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using a physics engine like Matter.js for realistic bouncing).
Backend: None (purely frontend).
Additional Tools: Canvas API for rendering bouncing shoes, sound files for boing effects, GitHub for version control.
